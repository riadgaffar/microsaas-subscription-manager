## Synopsys

Subscription Management System: A service that helps small businesses manage their subscriptions, including tracking expenses, managing renewals, and offering insights into spending.


## Overview

Building a Spring Boot micro SaaS MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a Subscription Management System involves several key steps, focusing on the essential features that allow small businesses to track expenses, manage renewals, and gain insights into spending. Below, I outline a high-level approach to building this system, including the technical architecture, key features, and technologies used.

### 1. Define MVP Features

For a Subscription Management System MVP, focus on core functionalities:

User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to register and log in to manage their subscriptions.
Subscription Tracking: Enable users to add, view, and manage their subscriptions, including costs, renewal dates, and service providers.
Expense Management: Provide functionalities to track monthly or annual expenses related to subscriptions.
Renewal Alerts: Implement notifications for upcoming renewals.
Spending Insights: Generate simple reports or insights on spending patterns and suggestions for savings.

### 2. Choose Technology Stack

Spring Boot: For the backend, leveraging its ease of development and scalability.
Spring Security: For secure authentication and authorization.
Spring Data JPA/Hibernate: For database operations, making it easier to work with relational databases.
MySQL or PostgreSQL: As the database system for storing user data, subscription information, etc.
Angular or React: For the frontend, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure and stateless authentication between the frontend and backend.
Spring Mail: For sending renewal alerts and notifications via email.

### 3. Design the Application Architecture

Microservices Architecture: Design your system using microservices for scalability and better management. Each core feature (e.g., user management, subscription tracking, expense management) can be a separate microservice.
API Gateway: Implement an API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices, handle load balancing, and provide a single entry point for the frontend.
Service Registry and Discovery: Use Netflix Eureka or Spring Cloud Discovery for microservices to register themselves and to discover other services.

### 4. Implement the Backend

Setup Spring Boot Project: Start with Spring Initializr to set up your Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA).
Develop Microservices: Create microservices based on the defined features. Implement REST APIs for communication between the frontend and the backend.
Secure the Application: Use Spring Security and JWT for authentication and authorization.
Database Integration: Use Spring Data JPA to integrate with your chosen database and model your entities (User, Subscription, Expense, etc.).

### 5. Develop the Frontend

Choose a modern framework/library (Angular or React) and set up the project.
Implement the UI based on the features, ensuring it's user-friendly and responsive.
Integrate with the backend using REST APIs, handling user authentication, displaying subscription data, and presenting insights.

### 6. Testing and Deployment

Unit Testing: Write unit tests for both backend and frontend to ensure the reliability of individual components.
Integration Testing: Test the integrated system to ensure that microservices work together as expected.
Deployment: Consider deploying your MVP on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku that support microservices and offer scalability.

### 7. Feedback Loop

After the MVP launch, collect user feedback to understand the product's strengths and areas for improvement. Use this feedback to prioritize future development efforts.

This high-level overview should get you started on building your Subscription Management System as a Spring Boot micro SaaS MVP. Each step can be expanded into more detailed tasks as you progress in your project.

## Initial Design Approach
- Spring Data JPA
- In Memory H2 database
- User and Subscriptions models/entities with one to many relationships
- Repository interfaces
- REST Controller

## TODOs:

### 1. Add Spring Security

### 2. Add JWT OAuth

### 3. Add Expenses Entity

### 4. Full Client test suit that mimics UI

### 5. Which UI libray/Framework?
  - Angular?
  - React (native)?
  - Vue?
  - Flutter?
